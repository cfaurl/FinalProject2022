# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I think that I am going to go off one of the tracks, either a game or a website. I think I am leaning more towards the website, so that way I can make a website and implement file reading. I'm thinking about doing something with finances.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I will not be collaborating, I don't like group work.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
I was going to ask you about my idea, I think I want to make a website which will allow you to type in a date and show you the stock market from that day in history. Do you think this will be to hard or is this plausible?
