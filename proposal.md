# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

WebStocksData

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I was going to make a website that will allow you to look at the data of certain stocks, and you will be able to see the data of that stock from the past ten years.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be making a website that will show you a number of popular stocks. You will be able to click on the stock you wish to see the data of that stock. It will show you the date, close/last, volume, open, high, and low of that stock. I was going to go off of the website lab from the choose your own adventure and create a page that listed these stocks. I also am going to find stock data from the past ten years and download those files, which I will implement into my code so when you click on the stock it will read the file and display the data.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to actually have a website that will list the different stocks, and have some of data able to be displayed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can finish my project because it doesn't seem that hard to do what I want to. A better outcome will be to have the website finished, and fully functioning, displaying the data it should display when you click on a certain stock.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I am able to finish it all, and that it will run perfectly with no errors, have a list of major stocks, when you click on the stock it displays the data it should, and maybe even implement graphs into this website too.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to do the choose my own adventure and look at which project will be more helpful for completing my project. I will also have to able to tweak that code that I wrote in the choose my own adventure so that way I can have what I need for this project. I will need to find popular stocks such as APPLE, etc and find data of that stock from the past ten years. I will need to be able to take that data and have my program be able to read those files so that way it will display the appropriate data.
